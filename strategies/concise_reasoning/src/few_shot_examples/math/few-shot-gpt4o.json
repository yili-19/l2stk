A space diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices that do not belong to the same face. How many space diagonals does $P$ have?\n",
        "solution": "To find the number of space diagonals in the polyhedron, we first calculate the total number of line segments connecting any two vertices. This is given by the combination formula for choosing 2 vertices out of 26, which is:\n\nTotal line segments = C(26, 2) = 26 * 25 / 2 = 325.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of edges and face diagonals from this total to find the number of space diagonals.\n\nThe polyhedron has 60 edges, so we subtract these:\n\n325 - 60 = 265.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the diagonals that lie on the faces. \n\nFor the 24 triangular faces, there are no diagonals since a triangle has no diagonals.\n\nFor the 12 quadrilateral faces, each quadrilateral has 2 diagonals. Therefore, the total number of face diagonals is:\n\n12 * 2 = 24.\n\nSubtract these face diagonals from the remaining line segments:\n\n265 - 24 = 241.\n\nThus, the number of space diagonals is 241.\n\nThe answer is 241."

How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
