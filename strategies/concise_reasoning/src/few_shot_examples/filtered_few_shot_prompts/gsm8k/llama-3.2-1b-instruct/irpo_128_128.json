        "solution": "Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we add the number of students in the three groups we know about. \n5 + 8 + 7 = 20 \nThe fourth group has 24 - 20 = 4 students. \nThe answer is 4."

        "solution": "To find the length of the smallest model mustang, we need to find the length of the mid-size model and then divide that by 2.\n\nMid-size model: 240 inches / 10 = 24 inches\n\nSmallest model: 24 inches / 2 = 12 inches\n\nThe answer is 12 inches."

        "solution": "To find out how many slices each person will get, we need to divide the total number of slices (which is 24, since 3 pizzas with 8 slices each) by the number of people (12).\n\n24 slices \u00f7 12 people = 2 slices per person\n\nSo, each person will get 2 slices of pizza."
