        "question": "Morgan goes to the drive-thru and orders his lunch.  He gets a hamburger for $4, onion rings for $2 and a smoothie for $3. If he pays with a $20 bill, how much change does he receive?",
        "solution": "To determine how much change Morgan receives, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of Morgan's lunch:\n   - Hamburger: $4\n   - Onion rings: $2\n   - Smoothie: $3\n   \n   Total cost = $4 + $2 + $3 = $9\n\n2. Subtract the total cost from the amount Morgan paid:\n   - Amount paid: $20\n   - Total cost: $9\n   \n   Change received = $20 - $9 = $11\n\nTherefore, The answer is $11."

        "question": "Mehki is 10 years older than Jordyn. Jordyn's age is double Zrinka's age. If Zrinka is 6 years old, how many years old is Mehki?",
        "solution": "Let's break down the information provided in the question and solve it step by step:\n\n1. We know that Zrinka is 6 years old.\n2. Jordyn's age is double Zrinka's age. Therefore, Jordyn's age = 2 * Zrinka's age = 2 * 6 = 12 years old.\n3. Mehki is 10 years older than Jordyn. Therefore, Mehki's age = Jordyn's age + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22 years old.\n\nThe answer is The answer is Mehki is 22 years old."

        "question": "Fred spent half of his allowance going to the movies. He washed the family car and earned 6 dollars. What is his weekly allowance if he ended with 14 dollars?",
        "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final amount Fred has and account for all his transactions. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Fred ended up with $14.\n2. Before earning $6 from washing the car, he had \\(14 - 6 = 8\\) dollars.\n3. The $8 represents the remaining half of his allowance after spending half on the movies.\n4. Therefore, before spending half on the movies, Fred must have had \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) dollars.\n\nThus, Fred's weekly allowance was $16.\n\nThe answer is The answer is $16"

        "question": "Ines had $20 in her purse. She bought 3 pounds of peaches, which are $2 per pound at the local farmers\u2019 market. How much did she have left?",
        "solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Determine the cost of the peaches:\n   - The price of peaches is $2 per pound.\n   - Ines bought 3 pounds of peaches.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the peaches = 3 pounds * $2/pound = $6.\n\n2. Calculate how much money Ines has left after purchasing the peaches:\n   - Ines initially had $20.\n   - She spent $6 on peaches.\n   - Money left = Initial amount - Cost of peaches = $20 - $6 = $14.\n\nThe answer is $14"

        "solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the tumblers:\n   Mrs. Peterson bought 10 tumblers at $45 each.\n   Total cost = 10 * $45 = $450\n\n2. Determine the amount of money Mrs. Peterson paid:\n   She paid with five $100 bills.\n   Total payment = 5 * $100 = $500\n\n3. Calculate the change she should receive:\n   Change = Total payment - Total cost\n   Change = $500 - $450 = $50\n\nTherefore, The answer is $50."
