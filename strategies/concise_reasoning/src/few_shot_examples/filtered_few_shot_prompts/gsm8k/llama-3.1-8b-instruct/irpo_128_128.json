        "question": "There were 40 kids on Lake Pleasant. A fourth of the kids went tubing, but only half of the tubers went rafting. How many of the kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion?",
        "solution": "To find out how many kids were on the tubing excursion, we need to calculate a fourth of 40, which is 40 \u00f7 4 = 10.\n\nSince only half of the tubers went rafting, we need to find half of 10, which is 10 \u00f7 2 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n\nThe answer is 5."

        "solution": "To find out how many turns Barry can take standing on his head, we need to determine how many 15-minute blocks are in a 2-hour period. \n\nA 2-hour period is equal to 120 minutes. \n\nWe divide the total number of minutes (120) by the time it takes for each turn (15 minutes). \n\n120 / 15 = 8\n\nThe answer is 8"

        "solution": "To find the difference in calories per hour, we first need to calculate the total calories Brandon gets from catching squirrels and rabbits.\n\nCatching 6 squirrels gives Brandon 6 x 300 = 1800 calories.\n\nCatching 2 rabbits gives Brandon 2 x 800 = 1600 calories.\n\nThe difference in calories is 1800 - 1600 = 200.\n\nThe answer is 200."

        "solution": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Zrinka is 6 years old.\n2. Jordyn's age is double Zrinka's age, so Jordyn is 2 x 6 = 12 years old.\n3. Mehki is 10 years older than Jordyn, so Mehki's age is 12 + 10 = 22 years old.\n\nThe answer is 22."

        "solution": "Let's break this problem down step by step:\n\n1. We know that Maude will be 8 years old.\n2. Emile will be six times as old as Maude, so Emile will be 6 x 8 = 48 years old.\n3. Anne will be two times as old as Emile, so Anne will be 2 x 48 = 96 years old.\n\nThe answer is 96."

        "solution": "To find the number of holes that remain unfilled, we need to first find the number of holes that Maynard filled.\n\nMaynard filled 75% of the holes. 75% of 8 holes is 0.75 x 8 = 6 holes.\n\nSince Maynard filled 6 holes, the number of holes that remain unfilled is 8 - 6 = 2 holes.\n\nThe answer is 2."

        "solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Azure Valley has 60 skirts.\n2. Seafoam Valley has two-thirds as many skirts as Azure Valley, which means they have (2/3) \u00d7 60 = 40 skirts.\n3. Purple Valley has one-quarter as many skirts as Seafoam Valley, which means they have (1/4) \u00d7 40 = 10 skirts.\n\nThe answer is 10"

        "question": "A pie shop charges $5 for a slice of pie. They cut each whole pie into 4 slices. How much money will the pie shop make if they sell 9 pies?",
        "solution": "To find the total amount of money the pie shop will make, we need to first find out how many slices of pie they will sell. Since they cut each pie into 4 slices and they sell 9 pies, they will sell a total of 9 x 4 = 36 slices.\n\nSince each slice costs $5, the total amount of money they will make is 36 x $5 = $180.\n\nThe answer is $180."
