        "question": "Ines had $20 in her purse. She bought 3 pounds of peaches, which are $2 per pound at the local farmers\u2019 market. How much did she have left?",
        "solution": "To find out how much Ines had left, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the peaches: 3 pounds x $2 per pound = $6\n2. Subtract the cost of the peaches from the initial amount of money Ines had: $20 - $6 = $14\n\nThe answer is $14."

        "solution": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Tim has 2 apartment complexes, each with 12 apartments. So, the total number of apartments is 2 x 12 = 24.\n2. Each apartment needs 3 keys, so the total number of keys needed is 24 x 3 = 72.\n\nTherefore, Tim needs to make 72 keys."

        "solution": "To find out how many slices each person will get, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of slices: 3 pizzas x 8 slices per pizza = 24 slices\n2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 24 slices \u00f7 12 people = 2 slices per person\n\nTherefore, I will get:\n\nThe answer is 2"

        "solution": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the lunch: $4 (hamburger) + $2 (onion rings) + $3 (smoothie) = $9\n2. Calculate the change: Subtract the total cost from the $20 bill: $20 - $9 = $11\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Morgan receives is $11."

        "solution": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the 10 tumblers:\n10 tumblers x $45 each = $450\n2. Calculate the total amount paid by Mrs. Petersons:\n5 x $100 = $500\n3. Calculate the change:\n$500 (amount paid) - $450 (total cost) = $50\n\nThe answer is $50."

        "solution": "To solve this problem, I'll follow the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of holes that Maynard filled in: 75% of 8 holes = 0.75 x 8 = 6 holes.\n2. Calculate the number of holes that remain unfilled: Total number of holes - Number of holes filled = 8 - 6 = 2 holes.\n\nThe answer is 2."

        "solution": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The pie shop cuts each whole pie into 4 slices, so they can sell 4 slices per pie.\n2. They sell 9 pies, so they can sell a total of 9 x 4 = 36 slices.\n3. Each slice costs $5, so they will make 36 x $5 = $180.\n\nThe answer is $180."

        "solution": "To find out how many students were in the fourth group, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Add up the number of students in the first three groups: 5 + 8 + 7 = 20\n2. Since there are 24 total students, I will subtract the number of students in the first three groups from the total: 24 - 20 = 4\n\nThe answer is 4."
