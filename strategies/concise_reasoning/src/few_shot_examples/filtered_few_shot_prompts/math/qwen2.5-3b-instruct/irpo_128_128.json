        "question": "Sixteen is 64$\\%$ of what number?",
        "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to understand that \"sixteen is 64% of a certain number\" translates to an equation where 16 is equal to 64% (or 0.64 in decimal form) of that unknown number. Let's denote the unknown number as \\( x \\). Thus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 16 = 0.64x \\]\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( x \\). To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 0.64:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{16}{0.64} \\]\n\nNow, let's perform the division:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{16}{0.64} = 25 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is The answer is 25."
