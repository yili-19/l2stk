        "solution": "Step 1: Let's assume the number we are looking for is x.\nStep 2: We know that 64% of x is equal to 16, so we can set up the equation: 0.64x = 16\nStep 3: To solve for x, we need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.64.\n\nThe answer is 25"

        "solution": "To find the volume of the rectangular prism, let's denote the length, width, and height of the prism as l, w, and h, respectively.\n\nSince the prism is a right rectangular prism, we can set up equations based on the areas of its faces. The three faces are:\n\nlw = 48\nlh = 49\nwh = 50\n\nWe can multiply these three equations together to get:\n\n(lw)(lh)(wh) = 48*49*50\nl^2w^2h^2 = 117600\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to get:\n\nlwh = \u221a117600 \u2248 342.93\n\nSo, the volume of the prism is approximately 343 cubic units."
