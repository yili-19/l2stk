        "solution": "Since $|x-2|=p$, then $x-2=p$ or $x-2=-p$.  Since $x<2$, then $x-2=-p$.  Thus, $x=2-p$ and $x-p=2-p-p=2-2p$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{2-2p}$."

        "solution": "The mean of a set of n numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by n.  Since the mean is always at least as large as the smallest number, at most n \u2013 1 numbers can exceed the mean.  Therefore, at most 107 \u2013 1 = 106 students can be awarded extra credit.\n\nThe answer is 106."

        "solution": "Step 1: The degree of the remainder of the division of two polynomials is less than the degree of the divisor. In this case, the divisor is a quadratic polynomial (a polynomial of degree 2), so the remainder must be of degree less than 2.\n\nStep 2: This means the remainder can be either a constant (degree 0) or a linear polynomial (degree 1).\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the possible degrees of the remainder are 0 and 1.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{0,1}$"

The prime numbers in this range are 23 and 29.\n\nStep 2: Check if the remainder is 5 when each of the prime numbers is divided by 8. For 23: 23 \u00f7 8 = 2 remainder 7. For 29: 29 \u00f7 8 = 3 remainder 5.\n\nStep 3: Determine which number is the value of n. The remainder of 5 when divided by 8 corresponds to the number 29.\n\nThe answer is 29."

        "solution": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular prism be $a$, $b$, and $c$. Then, the given areas tell us that $ab=48$, $ac=49$, and $bc=50$.\n\nMultiplying these equations, we get $(abc)^{2}=48\\cdot49\\cdot50$. Solving for $abc$, we have $abc=\\pm\\sqrt{117600}=\\pm 342.9$.\n\nSince $abc$ must be a positive value, we take the positive square root. Therefore, the volume of the prism is approximately $\\boxed{343}$ cubic units.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{343}$."

        "solution": "Step 1:  To begin with, we need to understand that the probability of the dart landing in a particular region is the ratio of the area of that region to the total area of the dartboard.\nStep 2:  The total area of the dartboard is given by the formula for the area of a circle, which is $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\nStep 3:  The probability of the dart landing in a particular region is given as $\\frac{1}{6}$, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{\\theta}{360}=\\frac{1}{6}$, where $\\theta$ is the measure of the central angle of the region in degrees.\nStep 4:  We can then solve for $\\theta$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $360$ to isolate $\\theta$, which gives us $\\theta=\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot360=60$ degrees.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the corresponding measure of the central angle of this section of the dartboard is $60$ degrees.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{60}$."
