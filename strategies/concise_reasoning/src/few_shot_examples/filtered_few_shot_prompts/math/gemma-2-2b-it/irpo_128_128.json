        "solution": "Here's the reasoning:\n\n* **Understanding Polynomial Division:** When a polynomial is divided by another polynomial, the remainder will always have a lower degree than the divisor.  \n* **Degree and Remainders:** The degree of a remainder is determined by the highest power of the variable in the remainder. \n* **The Divisor's Degree:**  The divisor, $2x^2 - 7x + 18$, has a degree of 2.\n* **Finding Possible Remainders:** The possible degrees of the remainder are determined by the possible degrees of the terms that could be left over after dividing.
