The next palindrome greater than 40,305 is 40,404.

        "solution": "When a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by another polynomial \\( D(x) \\), the division algorithm tells us that we can write:\n\n\\[ P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x) \\]\n\nwhere \\( Q(x) \\) is the quotient and \\( R(x) \\) is the remainder. The degree of the remainder \\( R(x) \\) must be less than the degree of the divisor \\( D(x) \\). In this problem, the divisor is \\( 2x^2 - 7x + 18 \\), which is a polynomial of degree 2.
